# FAQ

## Why can you not find an emoji but can render it in the console!

This tool uses the `NotoEmoji-Regular` font which is open-source from Google. Sometimes this is out of sync with the licensed fonts installed in your console.

## Whats Twitter got to do with this?

If the tool cannot find an emoji witihn it's font (which is five years old now) then it uses twemoji to download a png of the emoji from a CDN.

## Why not use the latest `NotoColorEmoji.tff`?

Be my guest friend, but note you'll first have to add CBLC/CBDT support to `fontkit`. You might find it tricky given the format was used by Google in Noto, but the only docs I found were by Microsoft [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cbdt).

# Development

Standard `Node` project with `Typscript`. It was developed inside a VSCode `.devcontainer` so you should be able to just use `Remote-Containers` to open it and all the tools will be installed. VSCode tasks and launches used for debugging.
